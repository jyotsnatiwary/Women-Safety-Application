## Women-Safety-App

AIM:

To develop a dynamic android application that ensures women safety. The application takes the details of user as input and the phone number of their guardians. On any sort of inconvenience or ambiguity the user can simply shake the phone and it will send a message to the registered guardianâ€™s number and hence the needful remedial will be easily done.

An android app which can INSTANTLY alert the Guardians( along with user location ) whenever the user is in an emergency situation. It can be triggered just by shaking the android device in which the app is installed.

The android application detects the motion through a motion sensor listener in the accelerometer class. Then the shake function of the app gets activated and it calls the instructions on the onCreate() function and the message transfers well.
